# Data Compilation In Noita

In this project the goal had been to take a piece of data that was not in an already usable format, and process it into something that is usable. Thus, I have taken data from a game called Noita, and turned the data into a useable format (i.e., CSV) that I could import into PostgreSQL and begin data analyzation upon.

# Data Compilation In Noita

In this project the goal had been to take a piece of data that was not in an already usable format, and process it into something that is usable. Thus, I have taken data from a game called Noita, and turned the data into a useable format (i.e., CSV) that I could import into PostgreSQL and begin data analyzation upon.

## Description

I began this project with the goal of locating a data that was not readily available for analysis; thus, I had come across Noita. To my suprise, I had possessed around 30-hours of gameplay in Noita, a dunegeon crawler type game. waht is that you might ask, in this case to put it simply, it is a game that has no end-goal, you simply progress deeper into the dungeons that you are presented with battling monsters along the way until you eventually die; thus, in most cases these game sessions can be quite quick, or quite long. In my case with an avergae game time of around 7-minutes, my games felt long, but were not. I had then began to search the game files for data that I could scrape together when I had come across several "xml" files of data from each of my play sessions; however, I was in a bind. I did not understand "xml" nor how to pull the data I wanted from it; thus, I began my search for a python library, and stumbled upon ElementTree, a Python library curated for reading data from "xml" files. I then learned it enough just for it to be usebale for what I needed, and then read the data from each "xml" file in a folder that possessed the ending similar to "-stats.xml". In this process of parsing through the each folder, I had the data written to a "csv" file using the Python library "CSV". To put it simply, utilizing the library ElementTree, and Glob; I open the folder of data files, open up each file one at a time, then read and write that data to a CSV file utilizing the library CSV.
